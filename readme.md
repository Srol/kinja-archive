# kinja-archive

This code downloads your Kinja archive.

Python 3.7 is recommended. Not sure how far back this would go.

You'll need library bs4 as well.

Run it: python kinja.py <username> [--images]

Where 'username' is your real Kinja username, where your profile lives,
and --images will download the images in your articles if you wish.

The script will create new folders underneath by year.

I take no blame for bandwidth costs or any other ill consequences. Don't
run this in an environment where you might break anything.
